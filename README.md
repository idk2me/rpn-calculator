# RPN Calculator with CLI

I was learning go and decided to implement my own stack data structure. This lead to me writing a calculator that implements Reverse Polish Notation. 

## Overview

- Stack implementation with methods
- Tokenizer
- Token struct and enum
- Calculator that uses the stack and Token
- Test cases
  - Testing stack push, pop, peek logic
  - Testing calculator output against pre-defined input
